I have a few minor modifications. I use real cream, but instead of dairy milk, I use oat milk, since we never have dairy milk on hand. The only other alteration is I use Himalayan sea salt and I double it. This is a really delicious ice cream. Just made a batter, can't wait for tomorrow when I will churn it for Sunday dinner's dessert."
